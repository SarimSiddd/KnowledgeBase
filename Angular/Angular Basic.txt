- Modular based architecture

	RootModule (app Module)
	
	Module1 				Module2
	
	Module1a Module1b 			Module2b

- Each module can have multiple sub modules

	
- Each module can also have multiple components and services

- Each component can have multiple services and components


We can generate a component using

ng generate component [componentName]

This creates a 

.html, .scss and .ts file.

This component is then added into the appModule.ts file.

This component's html code can then be used anywhere in our project.

Structural Directives

NgIf, NgFor, NgSwitch

A component is also a directive.
