Every Linux system, has three requirements:

- A bootloader
- An OS
- A root filesystem

It additionally has two optional components:

If the processor family is ARM or PPC (32- or 64-bit), a Device Tree Blob (DTB) image file
An initramfs (or initrd) image file


"du -h ." - gives the size of the current directory in linux


Cao Jin has a great diagram explaining KConfig and KBuild at a high level.


Step 1 

- Download and extract a specific Kernel from https://www.kernel.org
OR
- Clone Linus Trovalds or anyone else's source tree e.g. linux-next

Step 2:

Extract the kernel tarball


Step 3:

Configure the Linux Kernel


- Using make localmodconfig on Linux Source Tree will result in the kernel modules loaded in memory to be used as the basis of generating a config. This means that we don't have to specify the architecture for the config (since it gets it from the current OS).

Different configs can have different config options depending on the loadable modules (so one might see different options when running make menuconfig on x86 vs running it on arm64)
