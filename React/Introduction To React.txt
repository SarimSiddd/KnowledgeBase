JSX:

const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;


Can combine UI elements with Javascript. React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.


Embedding expressions in JSX:

const name = 'Josh Perez';
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;

After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects.

This means that you can use JSX inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions.
