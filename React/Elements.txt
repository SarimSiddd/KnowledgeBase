ElementsUnlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.


Elements are what components are “made of”, and we encourage you to read this section before jumping ahead.

<div id="root"></div>

We call this a “root” DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM.

const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));


React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time.


function tick() {
  const element = (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
  );
  ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
}

setInterval(tick, 1000);

React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.
