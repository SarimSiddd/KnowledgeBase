RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation

- Allows for semantic search
- Allows us to supply the model that will answer the question with context
- Don't need to repeatedly give huge context to the model, only need to give the necessary context

Transformer

- Transforms text,audio,video etc. to a different space (e.g. text to 3D vector space)

Agent

- Agentic (Can interact with their environment)
- Can use tools (function calls) to interact with the environment e.g. Asking an agent to open the browser can make the agent call a function that will allow it to open the browser
- Can combine multiple agents together, passing data from one agent to another


Chains

Chains in LangChain are sequences of operations that combine different components (like retrieving documents, formatting prompts, calling LLMs) into a single workflow
