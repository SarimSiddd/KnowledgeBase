Constructor - special method used to initialize the class instance

Methods - functions defined within the class to perform a task

extends - keyword to create child classes

There are two different ways to initalize classes:

1) Using the constructor for the class


2) Using the static property method

let p = {
	name : "xyz"
}

- Using the static property method means the constructor will not be called
- Inheritance does not take place
