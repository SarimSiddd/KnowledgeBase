Software layers to and from hardware


- Applications call functions in libraries. Some of those functions invoke the Kernel system calls.
- Some of those system calls interact with hardware.

Commands for HW Info:

- lshw and lspci - list hardware & devices
- lsusb and lsbk - list usb information
- lscpu and lsdev

* Not all distros have these commands

Information about disks:

- hdparm
- Write to proc, dev or sys files
- inb and outb
- setpci

Linux devices identify themselves in a standard way
