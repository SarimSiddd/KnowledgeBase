What is the Kernel?

The linux kernel is a program that needs to be run (loaded into memory and executed).

The program that loads the kernel into memory and transferring control to it is called a boot loader (e.g. GRUB).

Kernel has command-line parameters which are the responsibility of GRUB.

The Kernel is an API, it provides:

System calls
Virtual file system entries

   - proc
   - sys
   - debugfs

Device files 

The Kernel is a Gatekeeper

- Manages privileges
- Executes supervisor instructions
- Implements security policies
- Control access to hardware and other resources

The Kernel is modular

- image is Small
- sufficient to boot to user space
- optional functionality is added after booting
- allows for alternatives e.g. loading only drivers required for current hardware

/boot directory contains linux images

uname -r to find current linux image.

if you delete the file then you wont be able to reboot. (it will work for now since its loaded into memory)
