Types of Trees:

1) Binary Trees:


A node can have at most 2 children

Max Number of children at any node: 2^i where i is the current level


Types of Binary Trees:

Complete Binary Tree:

All levels of the tree are filled except perhaps the last level which is filled left to right.

Full Binary Tree:

Every node has zero or 2 children

Perfect Binary Tree:

Both full and complete i.e. every node has either zero or 2 children and every level of the tree is filled.


Traversal:

In-order:

LCR

Pre-order:

CLR

Post Order:

LRC


Min Heap:

A Min Heap is a complete binary tree.
Each child is greater than the parent.


Trie:

A trie is a variant of an n-ary tree in which characters are stored at each node. Each path down the tree may
represent a word.
