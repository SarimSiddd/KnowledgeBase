Axes of volatility:

Only two ways for things to change:

- At the same customer over time
- At the same time across customers

Axes should be independent

- Encapsulate from each other as well
- If both axes are affected, it might indicate functional decomposition


A good design should be resilient to changes in the user domain

Avoid solutions masquerading as requirements

Take requirements and try to identify areas of volatility
