only design technique that matters

- Decompose based on volatility
	- identify areas of potential change
		- Can be functional but not domain functional
	- Encapsulate in services
	- Milestones based on integrations not features
- Implement behavior as interaction between services or subsystems

Encapsulate volatility into services


Problems:

- Volatility is often not self-evident
	- Takes longer than functional
	- Getting management support
	- Fighting insanity
- Dunning Kruger effect
- Doctors of old
