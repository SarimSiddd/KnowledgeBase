QWidget is the base class of all user interface objects

3 different ways of connecting widgets:

1) Using the connect method
2) Through the form editor (drag and drop)
3) By defining the on_signal function in the class (selecting go to slot in the form editor)

Resource files are saved inside of our binaries. We can read from these resources files while our application is running but we cannot write to them

resources are immutable and stores inside the application

difference between exec & show?

with exec the user cannot go further until the dialog executing has been closed
Passing data between dialogs using exec (waiting until the child dialog has finished execution)



Model/View Programming:

Instead of the controller, we have a delegate

List model
table model
tree model - Parent child hierarchy

Important models:
