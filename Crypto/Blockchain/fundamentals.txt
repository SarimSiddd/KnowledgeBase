- Ledger is shared between the buyer and seller party

Blockchain:

- Single ledger
- Shared
- Permanent
- Immutable
- Copies of that single 
- chronological

Bitcoin:

- asset of value
- can be transferred without a authority
- Disintermediated
- Decentralized
- Trustless
- Eliminate the role of banks


Bitgold had a lot of elements of bitcoin


Double spend problem:

- Double spend involves spending the same money more than once

- We need to be able to uniquely send the digital asset of value

Byzantine fault tolerance:

- malicious actors have large incentives to "cheat" the system
- a byzantine fault presents a challenge to the integrity of the system as bad actors may try to send inaccurate data or fail to pass on the data


- A solution can be acheived by reaching Consensus, in which a majority of the participants agree on a course of action.
- In blockchain there are multiple consensus algorithms at work

Consensus algorithms:

- Proof of work (e.g. Bitcoin): Miners perform very resource intensive computer hash calculations using information recorded in the blockchain, in a race against other miners
	- protects against malicious actors
	- malicious party must invest a large amount of time and resource producing the "proof of work" necessary to have any influence on the blockchain

- Proof of stake: A validator needs to hold many coins to be able to create the next block

Theres a node called Miners, anyone can be a miner

- Role is to perform and confirm transactions
- Secure the network
- Solve cryptography challenges
- Miners are paid in bitcoin


Bitcoins wallets manage your keys, bitcoin address is hashed public key. bitcoin wallet will have a private key


4 components of bitcoin:

1) Bitcoin protocol is opensource, new crypto challenge is issued every 10 minutes - goes out to all of the miners
2) All miners are competing to find the specific hash to create the new block
3) A miner solves the challenge first
4) Rest of the miner community verifies the validity of the new block mined
5) The new block of transactions is added to the blockchain
6) miner gets reward in bitcoin

A block consists of:

block
nonce
data
hash


Miners mine the nonce to find the correct cryptographic hash to make the block valid
