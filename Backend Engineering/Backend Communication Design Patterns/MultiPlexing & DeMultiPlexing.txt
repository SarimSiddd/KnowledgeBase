Multiplexing:

- Multiple requests are transformed into a single request on the backend

DeMultiplexing:

- Single request is split into multiple requests


MultiPlexing examples:


In Http 1:

- When multiple requests are made in the browser, the browser sends multiple requests to the server

In Http 2:

- When multiple requests are made, a single "pipeline" is used for these multiple requests

In Backend:

Multiple http 1.1 calls could be sent to a reverse proxy server which then forwards the requests to a single HTTP/2 server using a single channel

 - More throughput
 - High backend resources (CPU for h2 (only one connection in use))

DeMultiplexing examples:

- less throughput
- less backend resources (CPU for h1)
