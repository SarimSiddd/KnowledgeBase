ICMP

Layer 3 protocol

- Traceroute, ping

internet control message protocol

- only operates mac addresses, no ports


- Designed for informational messages
	- Host unreachable, port unreachable, fragmentation needed
	- Packet expired (infinite loop in routers)
- Uses IP directly
- Doesn't require listeners or ports to be opened

- Some firewalls block ICMP for security reasons 
- Disabling ICMP can also cause real damage with connection establishment
	- Fragmentation needed
	- TCP blackhole
