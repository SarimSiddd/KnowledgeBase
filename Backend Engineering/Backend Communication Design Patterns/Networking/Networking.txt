- Router is responsible to route traffic from outside the network and it allows us to connect to computers outside the network.

- To communicate inside the network, we just need the mac address of the machine we want to talk to

- We need three things for network communication 
 - Gateway ip
 - ip address
 - subnet mask

255.255.255.0 is the 32-bit subnet mask where the last byte corresponds to the host.

so for e.g.

if 192.168.1.3 wants to talk to 192.168.2.2

the subnet mask 255.255.255.0 is applied to both ip addresses to get the subnet

if the subnet is different, we go to the default gateway

and then to the router (with the mac address of the router)
