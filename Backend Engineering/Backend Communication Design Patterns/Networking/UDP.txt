UDP

Layer 4 Protocol

Ability to address processes in a host using ports
Simple protocol to send and receive data
Prior communication not required (double edged sword)
Stateless no knowledge stored on the host
8 byte header datagram


Use cases:

- video streaming
- VPN
- DNS
- WebRTC


MultiPlexing and Demultiplexing:

- IP target host only
- Hosts run many apps each with different requirements
- Ports now identify the "app" or "process"
- Sender multiplexes all its apps into UDP
- Receiver demultiplexes UDP datagrams into each app



Pros and Cons

Pros:
- Simple protocol
- header size is small so datagrams are small
- uses less bandwidth
- stateless
- Consumes less memory (no state stored in client/server)
- low latency - no handshake, no order, retransmission or guaranteed delivery


Cons:
-No acknowledgement
-No guarantee delivery
-Connection-less - anyone can send data without prior knowledge
-No flow control (How many packets can the server handle? Whats the buffer size on the server?)
-No congestion control
-No ordered packets
-Security- can be easily spoofed (since there is no state, we don't know what the ip had been doing before)
