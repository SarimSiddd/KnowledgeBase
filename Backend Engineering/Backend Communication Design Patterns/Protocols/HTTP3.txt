HTTP over QUIC Multiplexed Streams


- HTTP/3 uses QUIC
- Like HTTP/2 QUIC has streams
- But QUIC use UDP instead


Pros and Cons:

- QUIC has many other benefits
- Merges connection setup (virtual connection concept) + TLS in one handshake
- Has congestion control at stream level
- Connection migration (Connection ID)

Why not HTTP/2 over QUIC

- Header compression algorithm
- Take alot of CPU usage (parsing logic)
- UDP could be blocked in enterprise systems
- IP Fragementation is the enemy (if UDP datagrams exceed the MTU size, the datagrams are broken down into different segments which QUIC does not allow)
