- Find a peer-to-peer path to exchange video and audio in an effecient and low latency manner
- Standardized API
- Enables rich communications browser, mobile, IOT devices


- NAT
- STUN, TURN
- ICE
- SDP
- Signaling the SDP


Pros:

- P2p is great! Low latency for high bandwidth content
- Standardized API I dont have to build my own

Cons

- Maintaing STUN & TURN servers
- Peer 2 Peer falls apart in case of multiple participants



Private IP address of the router -> Gateway
Public IP address of the router (The IP Address that the internet sees)


The router maintains a NAT table which keeps information about the source IP address from where the request came, and the External IP it replaced it with to communicate with the "outside world"	


NAT Translations method

- One to One NAT (Full cone NAT)

Packets to external IP:port always maps to internal IP:port without exceptions

- Address restricted NAT

Packets to external IP:port on the router always maps to internal IP:port as long as source address from packet matches the table (regardless of port)

Allowed if we communicated with this host before

- Port restricted NAT

Packets to external IP:port on the router always maps to internal IP:port as long as source address and port from packet matches the table
	
allowed if we communicated with this host:port before

- Symmetric NAT

Packets to external IP:port on the router always maps to internal IP:port as long as source address and port from the packet matches the table

Only allow if the full pair match
