Can send all requests at the same time on the same connection. Each connection has a streamID that uniquely identifies it

Pros

- Multiplexing over single connection
- Compression (Headers & data)
- Server push
- Secure by default
- Protocol Negotiation during TLS (ALPN)

Cons

- TCP head of line blocking (requests that are sent on the same connection are ordered by the server, if any of the requests drops packets - the server will request all of the requests to be resent)
- Server push never picked up
- High CPU usage
