LongPolling.txt

- Used in Kafka

- Request is taking long, I'll check with you later But talk to me only when it's ready

What is Long Polling?

- client sends a request
- server responds immediately with a handle
- server continues to process the request
- client uses that handle to check for status
- server does not reply until there is a response
- we got a handle, we can disconnect and are less chatty

Pros 

- less chatty and backend friendly
- client can still disconnect

Cons

- not real time
