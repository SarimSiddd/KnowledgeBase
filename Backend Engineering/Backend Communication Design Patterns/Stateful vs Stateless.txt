Stateful vs Stateless protocol

- The protocols can be designed to store state
- TCP is stateful
	- Sequences, Connection file descriptor
- UDP is stateless
 	- DNS sends queryID in UDP to identify queries

 - You can build a stateless protocol on top of a stateful one and viceversa

 - HTTP on top of TCP
 - IF TCP breaks, HTTP just creates another connection

 - JWT (Json web token) is stateless
