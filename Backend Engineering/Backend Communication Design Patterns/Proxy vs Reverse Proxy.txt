Proxy vs Reverse Proxy


- Client -> Proxy -> Server


Client knows the destination is the specified server but server does not have client information due to the client

UseCases:

- Caching
- Anonymity
- Logging
- Block Sites
- Microservices


- Client -> Reverse Proxy -> Server 1, Server 2 ... etc.


Server has client information but client has no information about the server doing the actual processing


Usecases:


- Caching (DNS)
- Canary
- Ingress
- Load Balancing
- Microservices
