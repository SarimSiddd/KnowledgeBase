- In the telnet days sending a single byte in a segment is a waste
- Combine small segments and send them in a single one
- The client can wait for a full MSS before sending the segment
- No wasted 40 bytes header ( IP + TCP ) for a few bytes of data

- I rather get performance than small bandwidth-
- TCP_NODELAY
- Curl disabled this in 2016 because it slowed down their TLS handshake
