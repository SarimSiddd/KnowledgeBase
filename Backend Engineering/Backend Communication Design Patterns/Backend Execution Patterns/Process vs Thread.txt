Process vs Thread


- A thread is a LWP (Light weight process) in Linux
- Shares memory with parent process
- Has a ID


Multi-Processes

- Processes can also share a pool of memory between them (e.g. Nginx & postgres)
- Take advantage of multi-cores
- More memory but isolated
- Redis backup routine (COW)
