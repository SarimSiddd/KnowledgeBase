- Unidirectional stream from the server side (twitter, facebook etc. use notifications, chat applications are also a good usecase)

- Used by RabbitMQ

- RabbitMQ will push entries from the queue to the client as soon as there is data in the queue

- Client doesn't request data, it just gets data

Pros
	- Real time
Cons
	- Clients must be online
	- Clients might not be handle ( Client might not be able to handle the influx of data - we dont wait for client to catch up)
	- Requires a bidirectional protocol
	- Polling is preferred for light clients
