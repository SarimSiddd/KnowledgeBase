1) Functions as first class values i.e. functions can be passed around like values.

e.g.

Func<int, int> triple = x => x * 3;
var range = Enumerable.Range(1, 3);
var triples = range.Select(triple);
triples // => [3, 6, 9]

2) Avoid state mutation i.e. original object is not changed

e.g.

int[] nums = { 1, 2, 3 };
nums[0] = 7;
nums // => [7, 2, 3]

3) Functional approach greatly benefits concurrency

pg 11 LINQ sheet


here are several language constructs in C# that you can use to represent functions:
 Methods
 Delegates

public delegate int Comparison<in T>(T x, T y);
var list = Enumerable.Range(1, 10).Select(i => i * 3).ToList();
list // => [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30]
Comparison<int> alphabetically = (l, r)
=> l.ToString().CompareTo(r.ToString());
list.Sort(alphabetically);
list // => [12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 3, 30, 6, 9]


The .NET framework includes a couple of delegate “families” that can represent pretty
much any function type:
 Func<R> represents a function that takes no arguments and returns a result of
type R.
 Func<T1, R> represents a function that takes an argument of type T1 and
returns a result of type R.
 Func<T1, T2, R> represents a function that takes a T1 and a T2 and returns an R.

There’s a similar delegate family to represent actions—functions that have no
return value, such as void methods:
 Action represents an action with no input arguments.
 Action<T1> represents an action with an input argument of type T1.
 Action<T1, T2> and so on represent an action with several input arguments.


 Lambda expressions

LAMBDA EXPRESSIONS
Lambda expressions, called lambdas for short, are used to declare a function inline. For
example, sorting a list of numbers alphabetically can be done with a lambda like so.
var list = Enumerable.Range(1, 10).Select(i => i * 3).ToList();
list // => [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30]
list.Sort((l, r) => l.ToString().CompareTo(r.ToString()));
list // => [12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 3, 30, 6, 9]
