Combinator Design Pattern:


Allows us to chain validations for a particular resource.

Allows us to find exactly which validation failed for a particular resource.


       result = isEmailValid()
                .and(isPhoneNumberValid())
                .and(isAdult())
                .apply(customer);

isEmailValid() returns a new CustomerRegistrationValidator with the overriden apply() method
and takes CustomerRegistrationValidator returned from isEmailValid and CustomerRegistrationValidator from isPhoneNumberValid
it first tries to apply this.apply from the first overriden and if successfuly tries to apply the second
