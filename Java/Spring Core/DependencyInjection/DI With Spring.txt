@Autowired: for the dependency that needs to be injected,  not required for the constructor

If there exists two concerete impls. Spring does not know which one to inject, in this case use the qualifier annotation or mark a bean as the primary bean:

@Qualifer("propertyInjectedController")
@Autowired
GreetingService MyGreeting; //Property autowired

@Primary
@Service
BonjourGreetingService implements GreetingService


@Service: for the service we're going to injecting, tells spring to manage this component through the application context

<<<<<<<<<<<----------------------- PROFILES ------------------>>>>>>>>>

@Profile
Allows us to specify the profile associated with a particular service, we can then specify the profile we want to use in application.properties and Spring injects the relevant service for us

E.g.:

@Profile({"FR", "default"}) 	//setting multiple default profiles
@Service
FrenchGreetingService implements GreetingService

If no profile is set then the default profile is used
