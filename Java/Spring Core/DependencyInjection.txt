Coding without depedency injection:

Objects take responsibility for managing their own dependencies

Generally leads to more tightly coupled code

Can require coding changes to manage changes with dependencies

Can make classes more difficult to unit test

- This means you see code with the new keyword - objects being initialized and all of that
