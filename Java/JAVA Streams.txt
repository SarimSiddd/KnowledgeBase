JAVA Streams


A more robust way to play with Collections and operate on them:

Map:

Applies a map function for e.g. split("") on an array of strings to get an array of chars instead

Reduce:

Used to apply the same operation on the entire collection. e.g. adding one to each element

Collect:

There are many collectors like Counting, Grouping etc. that we can pass as method references
