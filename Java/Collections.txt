Rule of Thumb:

Declare Collections as the most abstract type available.

For example:

Instead Of:

LoopOverArray(ArrayList<Car> MyArrayList)

we can rely on the most abstract interface which is Collection since List inherits from Collection
and ArrayList is implementation of List

LoopOverArray(Collection<Car> ArrayList)
