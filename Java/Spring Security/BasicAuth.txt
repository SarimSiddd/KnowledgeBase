Basic Auth:


client -> server

1. GetRequest -> (base64 user and pass in header is missing)

2. 401 unauthroized <-

3. GetRequest -> (base64 user and pass in header exists)

4. 200 OK


Note:

Client has to send the user and pass everytime in the request

This is normally good when implementing external APIs

No way to logout



@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity -> Enables spring websecurity
public class SecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
                .authorizeHttpRequests()
                .antMatchers("/", "index", "/css/*", "/js/*") -> whitelists these URLs
                .permitAll()
                .anyRequest()
                .authenticated()
                .and()
                .httpBasic(); -> Authenticate all requests with http Basic (base 64)
    }
}
