Aysnc, Finish:

For

sum = s1 + s2 + s3 + s4

s1+s2 can be executed on one core

s3+s4 can be executed on another

finish{
async
{
 sum1 = s1+s2;
 sum2 = s3+s4;

}
	sum = sum1+sum2
}

Async allows us to specifiy statements that can be executed in parallel

Finish allows us to cover the async block and execute statements after async has finished
