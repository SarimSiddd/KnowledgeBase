Most computer alogrithms follow the power law:

T(n) = an^b

where T(n) is the running time for input size n

where b is a exponent that tells us about the time taken for an input size


From running the experiment multiple times and timing it. We can find b as the log
of the ratio between two running times.

If we know b we can then solve for a after choosing a particular observation of input size n
