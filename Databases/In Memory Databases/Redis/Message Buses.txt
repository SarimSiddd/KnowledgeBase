Message Buses.txt


Streams:

- Data is persisted inside the bus 
- This is to prevent data loss if no consumers are available

- Append only data type
- Everything gets persisted
- Multiple ways to query the data
-Similar to log files


Append data to stream:

XADD <key> <ID> [<key> <value> ...]

Reading from streams:

XRANGE <key> <starting ID> <ending ID>

We can use - + instead of actual timestamps to get all:

XRANGE myevents + - COUNT 1

Subscribe to a stream (we get data whenever stream is written to):

XREAD [COUNT X] [BLOCK Y] STREAMS <key> <id>

if Block is set to 0, it will die after msg is received


PUB & SUB:

- Data is published wether there are consumers or not
- If there aren't the msg is lost

Benefits:

- Work for real-time data transport
- Lightweight
- Easy to use

Drawbacks:

- It doesn't keep history, so no recovery
- Unstable consumers mean data loss
