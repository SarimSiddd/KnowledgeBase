= Used for tree (part-whole hierarchies).
= Allows for objects to be encapsulated in the Composite without static implication.
= We can have leaf nodes (nodes that don't encapsulate other nodes) and Composite nodes (nodes which can encapsulate Component Nodes and leaf nodes).

Elements:

Component:

Global interface/Smallest unit of understanding that the entire tree will have.

Composite:

= Can either be a interface or provide partial definition to base classes.
= Will be inherited by classes that can encapsulate other classes.

Leaf:

= Classes that inherit from component and cannot encapsulate other classes.
