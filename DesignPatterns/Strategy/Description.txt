Exposes a common application context for various sorts of algorithm usage. Type of algorithm should change and not affect the client.

Elements:

Strategy:

Base interface of the algorithm being implemented, all subsequent algorithms inherit.

Context:

Accesspoint for the client to call upon an algorithm.

ConcreteStrategy:

Actual implementation of the algorithm.
