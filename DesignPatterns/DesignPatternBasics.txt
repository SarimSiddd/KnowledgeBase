Design Patterns

Scope:

			
Class 	Scope:

specifies whether the pattern applies
primarily to classes or to objects. Class patterns deal with relationships between
classes and their subclasses. These relationships are established through
inheritance, so they are staticâ€”fixed at compile-time.


Object  Scope:

Object patterns deal with
object relationships, which can be changed at run-time and are more dynamic. Almost
all patterns use inheritance to some extent. So the only patterns labeled "class
patterns" are those that focus on class relationships. Note that most patterns
are in the Object scope.


Creational class patterns defer some part of object creation to subclasses, while
Creational object patterns defer it to another object. The Structural class
patterns use inheritance to compose classes, while the Structural object patterns
describe ways to assemble objects. The Behavioral class patterns use inheritance
to describe algorithms and flow of control, whereas the Behavioral object patterns
describe how a group of objects cooperate to perform a task that no single object
can carry out alone.
