Protobuf is a binary protocol developed by Google to be used with gRpc.

It allows automatic creation of go schema files from protobuf files (using protoc)

These files contain the schema definition of api calls between clients and the server

.proto->.protoc->.go

protocol buffers always use pointers because they contain a lock that cannot be copied

Never copy protocol buffer struct 

gRPC is a replacement protocol for http

//go:generate mkdir -p pb
//go:generate protoc --go_out=pb ./invo.proto

Adding reflection means the client can dynamically access the grpc service without needing the protobuf definition

Context#WithValue can be used to pass metadata, gRPC has its own status codes like HTTP

gRPC supports

- streaming
- req/response (unary, bidrectional, server streaming, client streaming)

middlewares are called interceptors in grpc

grpc gateway can be used for a http client that communicates via json
