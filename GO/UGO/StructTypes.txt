A literal struct (unnamed type in GO):

	e1 := struct {
		value1 int64
		value2 string
		value3 int64
	}{
		value1: 50,
		value2: "Hello",
		value3: 20,
	}


When dealing with unnamed types in GO, implicit conversion is allowed. (this is because functions are also unnamed types and we pass functions to functions)

In all other cases explicit conversion is necessary
