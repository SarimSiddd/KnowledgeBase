- tests need to be '*_test.go' format
- wont be compiled into the production binary
- package name should be the same as the package we are testing if we want to test the unexported functionality
- should be in the scheme of 'example1_test' if we want to test from the user perspective
- Test functions should be in the format: 'TestDownload' otherwise they will not be exported (test tool will not find them)


Table tests:
- Myriad of tests with multiple inputs and outputs


- Don't mock databases
- Dont mock services with specific protocols (use a docker instead)

doc.go for adding documentation


coverage:

go test -cover
go test -coverprofile c.out <- creates a cover profile
go tool cover -html c.out <- generate html profile from c.out
