Frames are not dynamic, if compiler doesnt know the size of the type at compile time, the compiler will need to allocate it on the heap

The maximum call stack in go is 2k, if this stack space is exceeded, GO will allocate a new stack that is 25% larger and all the frames from the previous stack is copied over
