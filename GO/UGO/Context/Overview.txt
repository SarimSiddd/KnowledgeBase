- allows cancellation and deadline on goroutines
- any api that does I/O should take context as its first argument
- never hide data in the context
- careful when using value bag


Background:

- parent/background context
- empty context
- value semantics

TODO:

- when you dont know where the context will come from
- to lay it in early


context.WithTimeout:

- Enforces a deadline time that the goroutine has to complete in
- The goRoutine that creates the context needs to defer cancel

Transport:

- Pool of socket connections
