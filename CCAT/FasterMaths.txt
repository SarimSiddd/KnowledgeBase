CCAT (Employement Test):


Math questions:

Distance = (Speed x Time)

Weâ€™re asked to calculate how many hours it would take an aeroplane to travel 3000 miles if its speed is 400MPH. We were given the distance and the speed.

Hours = 3000/400

The quickest way to solve this division problem without a calculator is to first take off as many zeros as possible:

3000/400=30/4



Averages:


In this question, we are told about a group of three numbers whose average is 17. One number is 12, the second number is 19, and the third number is unknown and we are asked to find it.

12-17= -5

19-17 = 2

(-5+2) = -3
