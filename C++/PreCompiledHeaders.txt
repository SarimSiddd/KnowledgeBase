PreCompiled headers contained header files already "compiled" for use throughout the project.

We should use precompiled headers for includes that we need throughout our project like vectors, threads, string etc. from the STL Library.

Doing so will reduce build times and also give all classes the same common STL includes so we don't need to do includes in each of our files.

We shouldn't use precompiled headers for:

1) file native to our own project that change [Since pch will need to be built again each time]
