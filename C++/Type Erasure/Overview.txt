What are we trying to solve?

"Dependency is the key problem at all software levels" 

Solutions:

Inheritance

Drawbacks:


Design patterns

Drawbacks:

- second indirection causes performance hit
- small, manual allocations cause performance hit
- performance hit due to many pointer
- we need one strategy for every operation draw(), serialize()
- need to manage lifetime explicitly
- proliferation of inheritance hierachies
- circles, squares still know about all operations
