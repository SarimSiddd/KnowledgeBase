Once a const class object has been initialized via constructor, any attempt to modify the member
variables of the object is disallowed, as it would violate the constness of the object. This includes
both changing member variables directly (if they are public), or calling member functions that
sets the value of member variables.

const class objects can only call
const member functions, GetValue() has not been marked as a const member function. A const
member function is a member function that guarantees it will not change any class variables or
call any non-const member functions.


Const vs constexpr

constexpr is used for compile time constants.

Const can be used for both, but it is preferable to use const in run-time constants.
