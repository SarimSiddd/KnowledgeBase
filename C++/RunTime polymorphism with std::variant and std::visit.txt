Runtime polymorphism can also be acheived through std::variant and std::visit.

- Allows us to bypass the virtual table overhead
- Need to know all of the types beforehand
- Allows us to do polymorphism on unrelated types (duck typing)
- No coupling because of inheritance


Variant

Types - closed set
Operations - open set
