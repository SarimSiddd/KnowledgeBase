If two alternative functions could be called, but neither is better than the other, the call is deemed
ambiguous and the compiler gives an error. For example:
ptg11539604
Section 1.4 Functions 5
void print(int,double);
void print(double ,int);
void user2()
{
print(0,0); // error : ambiguous
}
This is known as function overloading and is one of the essential parts of generic programming
