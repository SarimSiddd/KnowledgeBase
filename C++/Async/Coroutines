The function to call to use coroutines with Boost.Asio is boost::asio::spawn(). The first parameter passed must be an I/O service object. The second parameter is the function that will be the coroutine. This function must accept as its only parameter an object of type boost::asio::yield_context. It must have no return value. Example 32.7 uses do_accept() and do_write() as coroutines. If the function signature is different, as is the case for do_write(), you must use an adapter like std::bind or a lambda function

Where are coroutines useful?

- Can be a replacement for callbacks
