In steps:

1) Open stream to https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs/spot/en/#diff-depth-stream

2) Consume snapshot from https://api.binance.com/api/v3/depth?symbol=BNBBTC&limit=100

3) Snapshots and book diff events will be for a range of symbols (i.e. limit order books for multiple symbols)

4) Should maintain a best price for each side (bid & ask)

5) If the quantity was 0 that means there was a match against an aggressive order and we should remove the bid/ask at that price level
