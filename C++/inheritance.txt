when a derived class inherits from a base class, the access specifiers may change
depending on the method of inheritance. There are three different ways for classes to inherit from
other classes: public, private, and protected.

If you do not choose an inheritance type, C++ defaults to private inheritance (just like members
default to private access if you do not specify otherwise).


class Base
{
public:
int m_nPublic;

private:
int m_nPrivate;
protected:
int m_nProtected;
};

Base can access itâ€™s own members without restriction. The public can only access m_nPublic.
Derived classes can access m_nPublic and m_nProtected.

class D2: private Base
{
public:
int m_nPublic2;
private:
int m_nPrivate2;
protected:
int m_nProtected2;
