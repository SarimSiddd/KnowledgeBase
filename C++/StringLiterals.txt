char * something = "asds";

asds is created in read only memory;

we can't modify or do something like:


something[2] = 'a';

As we are trying to modify read only memory this is not acceptable.


char is 1 byte means 8 bit. means we can store 2^8 possibities or UTF-8 characters.

For UTF-16 we use:

char16_t * name1 = u"weqwe"

For UTF-32 we use:

char32_t * name = U"sadasd"

For wide characters(2bytes):

wchar_t * name3 = L"QWEQWE"
