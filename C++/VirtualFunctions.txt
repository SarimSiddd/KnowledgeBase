Only the most base
class function needs to be tagged as virtual for all of the derived functions to work virtually.



If the return type of a virtual function
is a pointer or a reference to a class, override functions can return a pointer or a reference to a
derived class. These are called covariant return types. Here is an example:

class Base
{
public:
// This version of GetThis() returns a pointer to a Base class
virtual Base* GetThis() { return this; }
};
class Derived: public Base
{
// Normally override functions have to return objects of the same type
as the base function
// However, because Derived is derived from Base, it's okay to return
Derived* instead of Base*
virtual Derived* GetThis() { return this; }
};



IMPORTANT


when neither the base nor derived class function is called virtual then the calling function depends on the reference pointer when creating the object.

e.g:

base * b = new derived ();
base.func(); -> base version of func is called

derived * d = new derived();
derived.func(); -> derived version of func is called


when b goes out of scope, only b's destructor will be called. that is why we need to mark b's destructor as virtual.

when d goes out of scope, first d's destructor is called first then b's destructor.

similarly we should mark our destructor as virtual on the base class.

General rule of thumb:

If a single function is virtual in the base class then also make the destructor virtual.
