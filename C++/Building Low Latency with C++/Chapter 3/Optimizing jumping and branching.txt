Modern processors have pipelines where instructions are fetched and decoded in stages, and branch mispredictions can be costly, taking 10 or more clock cycles to resolve.

Various forms of branching in C++ include if-else conditions, loops (for and while), and switch statements.

Optimizing branching involves minimizing the complexity of if-else chains, simplifying loops, and structuring switch statements with ascending case labels for efficient implementation.

Replacing branching with table lookups or function pointers can be a good optimization strategy in some cases.

Loop unrolling can reduce branch mispredictions by duplicating loop bodies and avoiding checks that determine loop continuation.

Compile-time branching using if constexpr moves branching overhead to compile time but requires conditions that can be be evaluated at compile time.

Developers can provide branch prediction hints using attributes like [[likely]] and [[unlikely]], although modern processors are often good at learning likely branch outcomes.

int a[5]; a[0] = 0;
    for(int i = 1; i < 5; ++i)
      a[i] = a[i-1] + 1;
The compiler can unroll the loop into the following code shown here. Note that it is more than likely that for such a simple example, the compiler will use additional optimizations and reduce this loop even further. But for now, we limit ourselves to only present the impact of loop unrolling:


    int a[5];
    a[0] = 0;
    a[1] = a[0] + 1; a[2] = a[1] + 1;
    a[3] = a[2] + 1; a[4] = a[3] + 1;

    For GNU C++, these are traditionally implemented as follows using __builtin_expect:


#define LIKELY_CONDITION(x) __builtin_expect(!!(x), 1)
#define UNLIKELY_CONDITION (x) __builtin_expect(!!(x), 0)
