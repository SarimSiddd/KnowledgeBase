Double-precision calculations take about the same time as single-precision.

For integers and floating values, additions are fast, multiplications are slightly more expensive than additions, and division is considerably more expensive than multiplication.

Integer multiplications take about 5 clock cycles, floating-point multiplications take about 8.

Integer additions usually take 1 clock cycle, while floating-point additions take around 2-5.

Floating-point and integer divisions take about 20-80 clock cycles, depending on the processor and optimization.

Compilers optimize expressions, rewriting divisions as multiplications by reciprocals, and using bit-shift operations for powers of 2.

Mixing single- and double-precision operations or floating and integer values should be avoided as they may involve type conversions and added clock cycles.

Converting between single and double precision or between integers and floating-point values consumes clock cycles in computations.
