Local variables in functions are stored on the stack and offer good cache performance due to frequent reuse.

Register variables are the fastest form of storage and are used for frequently accessed local variables.

Static and global variables should be avoided due to inefficient cache performance.

The volatile keyword is used cautiously in multi-threaded cases to prevent certain optimizations.

Dynamically allocated memory can be inefficient and suffer from poor cache performance.

Small String Optimization (SSO) in C++ uses local storage for short strings to optimize memory usage.
