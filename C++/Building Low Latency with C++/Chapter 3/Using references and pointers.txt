In C++, many features implicitly use the "this" pointer to access class members, leading to frequent use of references and pointers.

Accessing objects through pointers and references is generally as efficient as direct access, thanks to modern processors' support for fetching and dereferencing pointers.

The drawback of using references and pointers is the extra register for the pointer and the dereference instructions.

Pointer arithmetic is as fast as integer arithmetic, but computing pointer differences may involve a slow division operation.

Smart pointers, like std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr, and std::weak_ptr, offer safety, memory management, and ownership control for dynamically allocated objects, with minimal overhead.

Pointer aliasing can prevent some compiler optimizations, and it's important to inform the compiler about aliasing expectations.

Developers can use "restrict" or similar specifiers for function arguments or functions to indicate no aliasing, but it's a hint to the compiler.
Alternatively, the "-fstrict-aliasing" compiler option can be used to assume no pointer aliasing globally.
