Components of a trading ecosystem:

These are the exchange components:

- Matching Engine
- Order gateway server and protocol decoder and ecoder
- Market data encoder and publisher

These are the client components:

- order gateway encoder and decoder
- market data consumer and decoder interested in this data
- trading engine


Orders that reach the exchange first are processed first in FIFO order.

- Orders that do not match immediately rest in the book and are referred to as passive orders.
- Orders that cross prices on passive orders are referred to as aggressive orders.

The matching engine arranges all passive orders sent by all market participants into a datastructure called the order book.

Limit orders are orders that can only execute at a price that is at, or better than, the price specified by the market participant.

Pro Rata and some mix of FIFO and Pro Rata are used to match orders. Pro Rata is simply a matching algorithm where larger orders get larger fills from aggressive orders regardless of where they are in the FIFO queue.
