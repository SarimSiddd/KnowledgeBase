String_views can be used as a substitute for strings and are readonly:

1) They just contain a pointer to an existing string and a count
2) Modifying an existing string view does not change the original string and does not result in the creation of new string view, it just changes the string view pointer & size hence it could be beneficial to use string view where string modifications are prevalent
3) Has iterators so is iterable and can be used to in STL algorithms that expect iterable objects
