Casting/Operator overloading:

Now in our example, we call PrintInt() like this:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
int main()
{
Cents cCents(7);
PrintInt(cCents); // print 7
return 0;
}
The compiler will first note that PrintInt takes an integer parameter. Then it will note that cCents
is not an int. Finally, it will look to see if weâ€™ve provided a way to convert a Cents into an int.
Since we have, it will call our operator int() function, which returns an int, and the returned int
will be passed to PrintInt().


A copy constructor is a special constructor that initializes a new object from
an existing object.
