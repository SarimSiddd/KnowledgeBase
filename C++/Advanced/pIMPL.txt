pIMPL:

pointer to implementation.

For a class X,

we seperate the implemenetation of X into pIMPLX.cpp and pIMPLX.h
X.h has a forward declaration to pIMPL.
where both of these classes have implementation of functions used in X.

X has a unique pointer to pIMPL and calls its functions.
We can include the header file of X and change implementation details in pIMPLX without requiring
a recompile.

can be moved but not copied.
need to always create a destructor for the implementation class (X).
