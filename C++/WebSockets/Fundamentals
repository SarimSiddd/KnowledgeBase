RFC6455

Full duplex connection

Both client and server can send messages

Can send data via json, binary, text - anything that the two endpoints agree to

Can be transported by proxies and firewalls


Divides messages into frames which have a predefined length. A message can have 0 or more frames associated with it
Control frames:

Ping, pong, close - allow us to control meta attributes 


Starts out as a regular http connection then the client sends a GET HTTP Upgrade message to make the communication web socket based

Buffers: (Both are constBufferSequences)


mutable_buffer 

const_buffer


A constBufferSequence is a non-owning range of read-only memory regions

Mutable buffer sequence (writeable):

mutable_buffer is also a mutable buffer sequence


Dynamic Buffer:

A resizeable buffer with a read area and a write area

Useful with the expected input size in unknown

Beast provides several dynamic buffer types
