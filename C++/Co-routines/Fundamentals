What is a co-routine?

A coroutine is a generalization of a subroutine

A subroutines can be 

- invoked by its caller
- can return control back to its caller

A simple function is also a subroutine

A coroutine has these properties but also:

- can suspend execution and return control to its caller
- can resume execution after being suspended

A function can either be a subroutine or a coroutine


Coroutine:

Invoke:

f()

Return:

co_return

suspend:

co_await

resume:

coroutine_handle<>::resume()

Whether a function is a coroutine is an implementation detail


A function is a co-routine if it contains:

a co_return statement
a co_await statement
a co_yield expression
or a range based for loop that uses co_await


To await on something, it has provide 3 things:

struct awaitable_concept{
	

	bool await_ready();
	void await_suspend(coroutine_handle<>);
	auto await_resume();

}

The simplest awaitable: suspend_always
suspend_never


coroutine_handle
