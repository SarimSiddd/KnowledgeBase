A very simple memory pool:

class someClass{
  public:
  
  int x;
  
  
};


int main()
{
    char * memory = new char [10 * sizeof(someClass)];
    someClass * obj = new (&memory[0]) someClass();
    return 0;
}


Memory pool consists of:

Chunks
 
Blocks are made of chunks

- often uses singlylinkedlist
