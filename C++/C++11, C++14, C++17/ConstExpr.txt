Constexpr can be used in two contexts:

Constexpr values:

Definition of an object
Declaration of static data
member of literal type

Constexpr function:

Functions
Constructors


Constexpr functions can both be called at runtime and compile time


constexpr double half_of (double x){

	return x/2;
}

constexpr double half = half_of (1.0);



char c;
std::cin>>c;
const double run = half_of (c);


C++11:
constexpr can only have one return statement
no body in ctor

C++14:
less restrictions
body in ctor
