Smartpointers manage object life time management

shared_ptr
-reference counting
-automatically destructs objects when they go out of scope
-use when you want to share the pointer. when the last object that refers to the shared
pointer goes out of scope, the pointer deletes itself
-make_shared improves performance (faster than a normal pointer and passing that around)

weak_ptr
-allows for null_ptr check
doesn't bump reference count 

unique_ptr
-less overhead than shared_ptr
-non_copyable (use std::move)
