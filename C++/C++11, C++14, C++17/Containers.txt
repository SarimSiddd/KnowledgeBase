Containers


-Have Type Safety
-Already templated types like vector that work great with existing STL algorithms
-Are easy to iterate
-don't have to manage memory manually (they destroy themselves)
-They know their size and manage themselves
-Promote Expressivity


for (int i : numbers) equivalent to foreach

vector numbers {0, 1, 2};

vector type is automatically detected from the initializer list. (C++17) feature

-not as memory intensive as people think
-memory locations for elements are contigious making random access faster
-can use iterator

use std::array else
