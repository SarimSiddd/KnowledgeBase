STL structure

Collections
-list
-map
etc.

Algorithms - Contain generic functions that act on those collections such as find, max etc.
to avoid duplication of those functions across the above collections

Algorithms act through iterators and gives them flexibility
e.g.

you can search from beginning or end of a collection by just using iterator::start() or iterator::end()
