A shallow copy means that C++ copies each member of the class
individually using the assignment operator. When classes are simple (eg. do not contain any
dynamically allocated memory), this works very well.

doing a shallow
copy on pointer values in a copy constructor or overloaded assignment operator is almost always
asking for trouble.

A deep
copy duplicates the object or variable being pointed to so that the destination (the object being
assigned to) receives it’s own local copy. This way, the destination can do whatever it wants to
it’s local copy and the object that was copied from will not be affected. Doing deep copies
requires that we write our own copy constructors and overloaded assignment operators.

The default copy constructor and default assignment operators do shallow copies, which
is fine for classes that contain no dynamically allocated variables.
 Classes with dynamically allocated variables need to have a copy constructor and
assignment operator that do a deep copy.
 The assignment operator is usually implemented using the same code as the copy
constructor, but it checks for self-assignment, returns *this, and deallocates any
previously allocated memory before deep copying.
 If you don’t want a class to be copyable, use a private copy constructor and assignment
operator prototype in the class header.
