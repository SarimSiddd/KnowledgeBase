An aggregate is just a struct containing some data members which does not have any:

1) user defined constructors
2) Virtual methods
3) static data members


Aggregate objects are default initialized:

struct A
{
    int a;
    int b {5}; //default initializer
    int c {3}; //default initializer
};

A aobj {2}; //b & c are default initialized, if no default value was provided, they would be initialized to 0

Designated initializers:

A aobj {.a{2}, .c{4}};
