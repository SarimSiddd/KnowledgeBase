#pragma once and 

#IFNDEF _SOMEFILE_
#DEFINE _SOMEFILE_

#ENDIF


Both do the same thing i.e. they make it so no file is included twice hence the signature of the file which references this file is only included once.


#include:

#include "" <- with quotes signifies a path relative to our directory

#include <iostream> <- Angular brackets signify a include directory path where this file is actually located, we can also use "" here


C++ include directory files don't include a .h extension
C include directory files do.



MACROS HELP US INCLUDE OR DEINCLUDE CODE BY CHECKING CERTAIN CONDITIONS

mostly used for debug and release checking 


#if PR_DEBUG == 1
#define LOG(X) std::cout << x << std::endl
#elif defined (PR_RELEASE)
#define LOG(X)
#endif
