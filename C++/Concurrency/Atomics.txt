Atomic variable is a memory location that you may use without the need for a lock.

Accessing an atomic variable simultaneously does not constitute a data race

Atomic variables ensure sequential ordering

Atomics are used in lock free algorithms

Turns off compiler optimizations, special assembly instructions(fences) are executed

- weak atomics should be avoided (not sequentially consistent)
