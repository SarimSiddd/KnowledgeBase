What is a bug:

Can be :

1) Logical
2) Correctness
3) performance
4) Non-deterministic correctness and logic


1. Scan and look:

- just look at the code and try to spot the bug
- can be combined with compiler flags to help us spot the problems


2. printf debugging

- see the actual values at runtime
- just use print statements to look at the values


3. Delta debugging

- Can help us narrow down search space
- Relies on good knowledge for a good delta

4. printf debugging using macros


5. Interactive debugger
