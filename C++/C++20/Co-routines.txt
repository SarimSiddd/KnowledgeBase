Allows for functions to suspend execution insde of the same scope 


generator f() 
{
	int i =0;
	//i exists inside this scope
	//and retains its value on each function call
	while (true)
		co_yield i++; //co-await for calling another coroutine from a coroutine

}

int main ()
{
	cout << f() << endl; //1
	cout << f() << endl; //2
	cout << f() << endl; //3 

	//A type pf coroutine:
	auto g = [i = 0]() mutable{
		return i++;
	};

	cout << g() << endl(); //1
	cout << g() << endl(); //2
}


Lazy way of doing things
avoids callback hell when using multithreads
