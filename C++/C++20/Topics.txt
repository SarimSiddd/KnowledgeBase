Concepts - typetraits made easy
Coroutines
Ranges - Makes functional programming more convenient
to_array function to convert pointer based arrays to std::arrays
spans - safer way to pass built-in arrays to functions
- iterable, so you can use them with range based for
- also can use them with standard library container processing algorithms

Built-in arrays vs C++ Arrays:

Size information is lost in C style arrays
== operators cant be used
cannot be assigned to one another
dont provide automatic bounds checking
