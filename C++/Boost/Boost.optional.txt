Boost.Optional

How to store and return optional values?

a) Use a pointer with nullptr indiciating missing value - doesn't communicate effectively to programmer, may be dereferenced
b) Store a default value, such as empty string - not cost effective, imagine vector of size 100 each with different allocation for the default value
c)std::pair <string, bool> where bool indiciates if the string is optional or not - requires extra handling 

Boost.optional

provides a construct that explicitly tells us that the value is optional
