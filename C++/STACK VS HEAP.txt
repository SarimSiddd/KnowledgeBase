STACK VS HEAP;


USE STACK WHEN:

A) OBJECT IS SMALL
B) PERFORMANCE
C) NO NEED TO USE DELETE
D) ONLY NEED OBJECT USE INSIDE THE BLOCK

//STACK EXAMPLES:
CLASSA OBJA(); <- CREATES ON STACK, DOESNT DO ANYTHING ON MANAGED LANGUAGES(C#,JAVA ETC.)
CLASSA OBJA(Param A)
CLASSA OBJA = CLASSA(PARAM A)

//HEAP EXAMPLE:
CLASSA * OBJA = new OBJA(); <- CREATES A POINTER ON STACK FOR CLASSA ON HEAP

HEAP OBJECTS LIVE OUTSIDE THE BLOCK IN WHICH THEY ARE CREATED AND NEED TO BE MANUALLY FREED
