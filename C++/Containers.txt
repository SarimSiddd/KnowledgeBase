Container classes generally come in two different varieties. Value containers are compositions
that store copies of the objects that they are holding (and thus are responsible for creating and
destroying those copies). Reference containers are aggregations that store pointers or references
to other objects (and thus are not responsible for creation or destruction of those objects).
